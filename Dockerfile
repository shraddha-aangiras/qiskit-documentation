# This Dockerfile is used to preview the docs in pull requests via GitHub Actions.
#
# Keep it aligned with ./start. This Dockerfile is similar,
# but it uses a private Docker image from IBM Cloud Registry rather
# than a public image from Dockerhub. It also sets the CLI args
# directly in the Dockerfile because the GitHub Action expects that.
#
# To test it out locally, you will first need an IBM ID that has permissions to the quantum group. This is currently restricted to IBM maintainers. Then, set up IBM Cloud:
#
#   1. Install IBM CLI, https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started
#   2. ❯ ibmcloud plugin install cr
#   3. ❯ ibmcloud login --sso
#   4. ❯ ibmcloud cr region-set global
#   5. ❯ ibmcloud cr login
#
#   Once logged in to IBM Cloud:
#
#   1. ❯ docker build -t qiskit-docs-preview .
#   2. ❯ docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -t qiskit-docs-preview
#   3. Open up http://localhost:3000
